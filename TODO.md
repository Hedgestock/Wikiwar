#TODO

##General
- [x] Display wikipedia page in an Iframe or so
- [x] Random selection of pages in wikipedia
- [x] Timer that stops when goal page is reached
- [ ] Set-up a server to hide the Iframe behavior and track user journey
- [ ] Graph of pages gone through
- [ ] Leaderboard
- [ ] Options to manually set the start and goal pages
- [ ] Number of click mode
- [ ] Number of pages opened mode
- [ ] User profiles or at least anonymous sessions
- [ ] Online room set up with invitations
- [ ] Online room set up with randoms

##Anti-cheat
- [ ] Think about and find a solution to prevent javascript/html injection (Maybe check for no jump of links with api that gives links to the page)
- [ ] Think about and find a solution to prevent false timer with javascript/html injection
- [ ] Remove previous page options on game start


#TOFIX
- [x] pages with redirection won't count as goal if hit from redirect url
- [ ] some character still seem to pose parsing/URL problems
